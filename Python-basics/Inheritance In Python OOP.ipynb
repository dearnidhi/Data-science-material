It promotes code reusability by enabling a new class to take on the attributes and behaviors of an existing class.\n","\n","#### Key Concepts\n","\n","1. **Parent Class (Superclass)**:\n","   - Also known as a base class or superclass.\n","   - It's the class whose attributes and methods are inherited by another class.\n","\n","2. **Child Class (Subclass)**:\n","   - Also known as a derived class or subclass.\n","   - It inherits attributes and methods from its parent class and can also have its own additional attributes and methods.\n","\n","3. **Inheritance Syntax in Python**:\n","   - In Python, inheritance is declared by specifying the parent class(es) in the definition of a child class.\n","   - Syntax: `class ChildClassName(ParentClassName):`\n","\n","4. **Types of Inheritance**:\n","   - **Single Inheritance**: A child class inherits from only one parent class.\n","   - **Multiple Inheritance**: A child class inherits from multiple parent classes.\n","   - **Multilevel Inheritance**: One class is derived from another, which is itself derived from another class.\n","   - **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class.\n","   - **Hybrid Inheritance**: Combination of two or more types of inheritance.\n","\n","\n","\n","#### Advantages of Inheritance\n","\n","- **Code Reusability**: Avoids redundant code by inheriting from existing classes.\n","- **Modularity**: Promotes a modular approach to software development.\n","- **Ease of Maintenance**: Changes made in the parent class automatically reflect in all child classes (depending on the design).\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"MhyPQVjyKv0A"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[" let's go through separate examples for each type of inheritance in Python: Single Inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.\n","\n","Example 1: Single Inheritance\n","Scenario:\n","\n","Imagine a scenario where you have a base class Animal with generic attributes and methods, and a derived class Dog that inherits from Animal and adds specific attributes and methods related to dogs.\n","\n","Single Inheritance Example:"],"metadata":{"id":"1isen0cSLNRB"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Mv0CMMJcKsNo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718427551813,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":484,"user":{"displayName":"KULDEEP","userId":"17644279283959378531"}},"outputId":"4c1ba1ce-ee57-4400-e665-d5b1a5c478ad"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Woof!\n","A Labrador dog (Canine) with 4 legs\n"]}],"source":["# Parent class\n","class Animal:\n","    def __init__(self, species, legs):\n","        self.species = species\n","        self.legs = legs\n","\n","    def make_sound(self):\n","        return \"Some generic sound\"\n","\n","# Child class inheriting from Animal\n","class Dog(Animal):\n","    def __init__(self, species, legs, breed):\n","        super().__init__(species, legs)\n","        self.breed = breed\n","\n","    def make_sound(self):\n","        return \"Woof!\"\n","\n","    def describe(self):\n","        return f\"A {self.breed} dog ({self.species}) with {self.legs} legs\"\n","\n","# Usage\n","my_dog = Dog(\"Canine\", 4, \"Labrador\")\n","print(my_dog.make_sound())\n","print(my_dog.describe())\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Example 2: Multiple Inheritance\n","Scenario:\n","\n","Consider a scenario where you have two parent classes, Father and Mother, and a child class Child that inherits from both Father and Mother, thereby inheriting attributes and methods from both parents.\n","\n","Multiple Inheritance Example:"],"metadata":{"id":"GrzztkUfLVXG"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Parent class 1\n","class Father:\n","    def __init__(self, eye_color):\n","        self.eye_color = eye_color\n","\n","    def play_game(self):\n","        return \"Playing chess with dad\"\n","\n","# Parent class 2\n","class Mother:\n","    def __init__(self, hair_color):\n","        self.hair_color = hair_color\n","\n","    def cooking(self):\n","        return \"Cooking with mom\"\n","\n","# Child class inheriting from both Father and Mother\n","class Child(Father, Mother):\n","    def __init__(self, eye_color, hair_color, name):\n","        Father.__init__(self, eye_color)\n","        Mother.__init__(self, hair_color)\n","        self.name = name\n","\n","    def play(self):\n","        return f\"{self.name} likes {super().play_game()} and {super().cooking()}\"\n","\n","# Usage\n","my_child = Child(\"Blue\", \"Brown\", \"Emma\")\n","print(my_child.play())\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"eWdOd8j2LZBa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718427722970,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":447,"user":{"displayName":"KULDEEP","userId":"17644279283959378531"}},"outputId":"0b9fd441-d1a2-44c3-cd51-993b9c38a339"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Emma likes Playing chess with dad and Cooking with mom\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Multilevel Inheritance\n","Scenario:\n","\n","In multilevel inheritance, a derived class serves as the base class for another class.
